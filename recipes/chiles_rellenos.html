        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>    
                <li>Brown your chiles on a pan.</li>
                <li>When they are golden and warm, you are going to put them in a bag for 30 minutes 
                    (this will make it easier to remove the skin because with the skin the flour will not stick).</li>
                <li>Now we remove the skin.</li>
                <li>Then you want to cut the chilli a littlle to add the cheese.</li>
                <li>Then you are going to add them to the flour.</li>
                <li>At this point you will want to beat the whites of your eggs.</li>
                <li>Once it has foamed, add one yolk at a time and beat between each yolk you add.</li>
                <li>Then you are going to grind the tomato with the onion and water until it covers the tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Once you have ground the tomatoes, you are going to add them to a pot and you will have to have the 
                    chopped squash and add it to the same and a little salt (salt to taste).</li>
                <li>Meanwhile you are going to submerge a chili in the egg and cook it in a pan with a little oil 
                    (don't lose sight of them because it will start to brown very quickly.</li>
                <li>And now you let them cook in the pot for 20 minutes. Bon Apetite!</li>
            </ol>
